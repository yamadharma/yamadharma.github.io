abstract: This work is devoted to studying the possibilities of hybrid modeling of communication network algorithms in the Julia programming language. A simulation of the system, which consists of an incoming stream processed according to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and a router processing traffic according to the Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm, is carried out. This model contains both continuous and discrete elements, for example, a discrete probability function of random packet dropping in the case of queue congestion.
