 abstract = {We have obtained exact kink-like static plane-symmetric solutions to the self-consistent system of electromagnetic, scalar, and gravitational field equations. It was shown that under certain choice of the interaction Lagrangian the solutions are regular and have localized energy. The linearized instability of corresponding solutions was established both for the case of flat space-time and that of interaction with the proper gravitational field.},
