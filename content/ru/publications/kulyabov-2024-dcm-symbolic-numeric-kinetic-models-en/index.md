abstract: Our group has been investigating kinetic models for quite a long time. The structure of classical kinetic models is described by rather simple assumptions about the interaction of the entities under study. Also, the construction of kinetic equations (both stochastic and deterministic) is based on simple sequential steps.  However, in each step, the researcher must manipulate a large number of elements. And once the differential equations are obtained, the problem of solving or investigating them arises. The use of symbolic-numeric approach methodology is naturally directed. When the input is an information model of the system under study, represented in some diagrammatic form. And as a result, we obtain systems of differential equations (preferably, in all possible variants). Then, as part of this process, we can investigate the resulting equations (by a variety of methods). We have previously taken several steps in this direction, but we found the results somewhat unsatisfactory. At the moment we have settled on the package Catalyst.jl, which belongs to the Julia language ecosystem. The authors of the package declare its relevance to the field of chemical kinetics. Whether it is possible to study more complex systems with this package, we cannot say. Therefore, we decided to investigate the possibility of using this package for our models to begin with standard problems of chemical kinetics. As a result, we can summarize that this package seems to us to be the best solution for the symbolic-numerical study of chemical kinetics problems.
