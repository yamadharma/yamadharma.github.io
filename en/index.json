Analysts who understand the subject area participate in their decision.\n     Often, machine learning algorithms in such systems are already in place.\n  To do something fundamentally new and really applicable here is extremely difficult.\n  “The apples that fell from the tree are already harvested.”\n   Analytical thinking   You need to deeply understand the subject area:\n what data is needed; are any predictive algorithms needed; is it possible to verify the prediction.    Requires an analytical approach.\n  Requires a culture of working with data.\n  Requires the ability to put hypotheses.\n   More important knowledge of the subject   The disadvantages of a typical Data Scientists include:\n almost do not ask any questions; data and so will tell about everything; use some arbitrary data; They say that they built some kind of model.    The result cannot be verified.\n   Universal specialists will no longer be IMHO, an effective Data Scientist\n can not be a generalist; must be an expert in the subject area.    Hype is over\nBut\nData science is not rocket science\n Project structure  How the data analysis project works  Project requirements Project data Development and implementation of the project   Requirements  We initially do not know anything about what data we have. We need to understand the statement of the problem. We must understand what result is required to get from the project. We must decide by what method the problem can be solved. We need to set data requirements.   Data  Search for data to solve the problem:  we will find out what sources are available to us; we form a sample with which we will continue to work.       Data research:\n explore the central position and variability; identify correlations between signs; build distribution schedules.    Data preparation.\n   Development and implementation  Model development. Software implementation of the model. Run training set. Testing on a test sample. Verification of the result. Loop (you can start all over again).   Requirements  Understanding of the task  It is necessary to clearly define the purpose of the study. What is the problem? What metrics will measure success?   The choice of analytical approach  If you need a yes / no answer, a Bayesian classifier is suitable. If you need an answer in the form of a numerical sign, then regression models are suitable.    If it is necessary to determine the probabilities of certain outcomes, it is necessary to use a predictive model. If you need to identify relationships, a descriptive approach is used.   Data requirements  What data will give the desired answer? Data requirements:  content; data formats; data sources.     Data  Data collection  We collect data from available sources. We make sure that the sources:  available; reliable; can be used to obtain the required data in the required quality.      It is necessary to understand whether we received the data we wanted. Revision of data requirements. Deciding on the need for additional data. Finding a replacement for missing data.   Data analysis  Are the collected data representative of the problem?    Descriptive statistics apply to all variables that will be used in the selected model:  the central position is studied (middle, median, mode); emissions are searched for and variability is estimated (variance, standard deviation); histograms of the distribution of variables are built; other visualization tools are used (for example, boxes with a mustache).     Data analysis  Correlations between variables are calculated. If there are significant correlations between the variables, some variables may be discarded as redundant.   Data preparation Data collection and analysis + data preparation = 70%\u0026ndash;90% of the project time.\n Data preparation  We process the data in such a way that it is convenient to work with them:  remove duplicates; process missing or incorrect data; we check and correct formatting errors.      We are designing a set of factors that machine learning will work with in the next steps:  feature extraction; feature selection.      Errors at this stage can be critical.  Excessive number of characteristics = model retrained. Insufficient number of signs = model is under-trained.     Development and implementation  Model construction When the type of model is defined and there is a training sample, we develop the model and test it on a set of features.\n Model application  Calculations alternate with model setup. Does the constructed model meet the original task?   Steps   Diagnostic measurements are taken to help determine if the model works as intended.\n  The statistical significance of the hypothesis is checked.\n  It is necessary to make sure that the data in the model are correctly used and interpreted and the result obtained does not go beyond the limits of statistical error.\n   Implementation   Implementation is carried out in stages:\n a limited group of users; test environment.

However, finding solutions of Maxwell's equations is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, various simplifying approaches are often used in optics. One such simplifying approach is to use the approximation of geometric optics. The approximation of geometric optics is constructed with the assumption that the wavelengths are small (short-wavelength approximation). The basis of geometric optics is the eikonal equation. The eikonal equation can be obtained from the wave equation (Helmholtz equation). Thus, the eikonal equation relates the wave and geometric optics. In fact, the eikonal equation is a quasi-classical approximation (the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin method) of wave optics. This paper shows the application of geometric methods of electrodynamics to the calculation of optical devices, such as Maxwell and Luneburg lenses. The eikonal equation, which was transformed to the ODE system by the method of characteristics, is considered. The resulting system is written for the case of Maxwell and Luneburg lenses.","tags":["rfbr19-01-00645","rinc","rudn5-100","scopus","wos","rinc"],"title":"Numerical analysis of eikonal equation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna-Maria Yurievna Apreutesey","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"5ee94f538dda82fe7424a40786042d93","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2019-ceur-ws-2407-red/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.568488Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2019-ceur-ws-2407-red/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of this work is to simulate the Random Random Detection algorithm (RED) and Double Slope Random Early Detection (DSRED) and Gentle Random Early Detection (GRED) modifications in Modelica.

This selective packet loss helps TCP find the right data rate faster and keep the queue size and latency at the appropriate level. The existence of a large number of modifications of the classical RED algorithm is associated with the problem of selecting the parameters of the algorithm (queue thresholds, maximum drop parameter, etc.) under which the system would function stably and efficiently. The Modelica language is used as the implementation language.

This paper provides a brief overview of the key improvements in the Cadabra system.","tags":["article","jcr-q4","rfbr16-07-00556","rinc","rudn5-100","scopus","sjr-q3","wos","rinc"],"title":"New Features in the Second Version of the Cadabra Computer Algebra System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tatyana Refatovna Velieva","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov","Sergey Aleksandrovich Abramov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"920fe0b45094be8400000c25f17c964c","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2018-icumt-aqm/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.432846Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2018-icumt-aqm/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-oscillating modes in control systems of computer networks quite negatively affect the characteristics of these networks so the investigation of parameters of self-oscillations as well as self-oscillations areas is actual. But due to the non-linear nature of usually constructed mathematical models the study of self-oscillations areas and parameters are extremely labor-intensive. It is of interest to obtain a so-called parametric portrait describing the zones of occurrence of self-oscillations depending on the value of the parameters: one parameter (two-dimensional graph), two parameters (three-dimensional graph), and so on. Such a parametric portrait allows us to purposefully manage the characteristics of the investigated control system. The paper describes a parametric study technique based on the method of harmonic linearization because in the standard mathematical model based on ordinary linearization by Taylor expansion a self-oscillation regime disappears (due to Taylor expansion linearization). To verify the theoretical results obtained, simulation is used. In addition, it is proposed to use the computer algebra system for analytical calculations. For this, the criteria for choosing software were formulated. Based on these criteria, a set of software for analytical and numerical calculations was proposed.","tags":["rfbr16-07-00556","rinc","rinc-core","rudn5-100","scopus","wos"],"title":"Parametric study of the control system in the TCP network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tatyana Refatovna Velieva","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Anastasiya Vyacheslavovna Demidova","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"106b7531acf8b0b3bbb97e7014178ab0","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2019-aisc-self-oscillation/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.741736Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2019-aisc-self-oscillation/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-oscillating modes in control systems of computer networks quite negatively affect the characteristics of these networks.

The determination of the optimal number of levels of the experiment and the number of repetitions at each level for robust testing. 3. The construction of the confidence interval for the resulting average run time. For the numerical experiment we implement 6-th order classical Runge–Kutta methods in both languages in the most similar way. We also study unvectorized versions of our functions. For Julia we tested not only built-in vectorization capabilities, but also external library. For processing the results of measurements Python 3 with Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy (stats module) were used. We carried out experiments for variety of ODE dimensions (from 2 to 64) and different types of processors.

При использовании такой случайной потери пакетов в очереди TCP-протоколы быстрее находят подходящую скорость передачи данных и удерживают размер очереди и время задержки на приемлемом уровне. Существование большого числа модификаций классического алгоритма RED связано с проблемой подбора параметров алгоритма (пороговых значений очереди, параметра максимального сброса и т.д.), при которых система функционировала бы стабильно и эффективно.

However, finding solutions to Maxwell's equations is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, various simplifying approaches are often used in optics. One such simplifying approach is to use the approximation of geometric optics. The approximation of geometric optics is constructed with the assumption that the wavelengths are small (short-wavelength approximation). The basis of geometric optics is the eikonal equation. The eikonal equation can be obtained from the wave equation (Helmholtz equation). Thus, the eikonal equation relates the wave and geometric optics. In fact, the eikonal equation is a quasi-classical approximation (the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin method) of wave optics. This paper shows the application of geometric methods of electrodynamics to the calculation of optical devices, such as lenses Maxwell and Luneburg. The eikonal equation, which was transformed to the ODE system by the method of characteristics, is considered. The resulting system is written for the case of Maxwell and Luneburg lenses and solved by standard numerical methods.

However, there arises the question of the insufficiency of the Riemannian structure for describing the constitutive tensor of the Maxwell's equations. The authors analyze the structure of the constitutive tensor and correlate it with the structure of the metric tensor of Riemannian geometry. It is concluded that the use of the quadratic metric for the geometrization of Maxwell's equations is insufficient, since the number of components of the metric tensor is less than the number of components of the constitutive tensor.

The mechanism of general renovation with retrials means that the packet at the end of its service in accordance with a given probability distribution discards a certain number of other packets from the buffer and itself stays in the system for another round of service, or simply leaves the system without any effect on it.

Under the assumption of the existence of a stationary regime, the steady-state probability distribution (for the embedded Markov chain) of the number of packets in the system is obtained, as well as some other characteristics, such as the probability of the accepted task to be served or the probability of the accepted task to be dropped from the buffer, the probability distribution of number of repeated services.

In particular, it is known about the presence of ferromagnetic properties at temperatures up to 200 C and above in a single-layer graphene films that are free from impurities. Previously there was proposed a quantum field theoretical model describing the possible mechanism of ferromagnetism in graphene as a result of spontaneous breaking of spin symmetry of the surface density of valence electrons. The possible spatial configurations of the localized spin density were described. In this paper we investigate such spatially localized nonlinear spin configurations of the valence electron density on the graphene surface such as kinks, and their interactions, as well as quasibound metastable states of the interacting kinks and antikinks, that are breathers. The spectrum of such breathers is investigated. It is shown that under certain conditions, this spectrum has a discrete sector, which, in turn, allows us to speak about the possibility of coherent quantum generation of spin waves in graphene structures, which is important in terms of practical applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.","tags":["article","rfbr16-07-00556","rinc","rudn5-100","vak","rinc"],"title":"Simple Model of Nonlinear Spin Waves in Graphene Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Tatyana Refatovna Velieva","Ekaterina Gennadyevna Eferina","Leonid Antonovich Sevastianov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"16b7c437f9f366beb7646d912065a373","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2018-aisc-metodology/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.613894Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2018-aisc-metodology/","section":"publication","summary":"Self-oscillating modes in computer networks control systems quite negatively affect the characteristics of these networks.

It manifests itself in the form of auto-oscillations, which may capture the whole segment of the network. As a result, the network parameters such as the bandwidth, latency, etc. are degraded. The reason for this phenomenon is the interaction of control elements in the network (for example, active traffic management modules) and protocols such as TCP. To prevent this phenomenon, it is proposed to control the parameters of the network control elements (since the prospects of a radical modification of the TCP protocol seem somewhat illus ory to us). Specifically, we are studying the active traffic control modules of the RED type. To isolate the main parameters on which the occurrence of self-oscillations may depend, we assumed to linearize the m odel with its subsequent investigation. However, the standard linearization leads to the disappearance of the self-oscillatory regime. We suggest to use the method of harmonic linearization, which preserves the self-oscillatory regime. So the method of harmonic linearization is briefly considered in our paper. We also highlight the main criteria that can be used to determine the presence of self-oscillations and to det ermine their parameters. The application of the harmonic linearization method is demonstrated with the help of the RED active traffic control module.","tags":["rfbr15-07-08795","rfbr16-07-00556","rinc","rudn5-100","scopus","rinc"],"title":"The Criteria for the Study of Occurrence of Self-Oscillation Mode of Active Traffic Management Module","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Sergeevich Zaryadov","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov","Tatiana Aleksandrovna Milovanova","Vladimir Tsurlukov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"8945245307ac126cfa3b6c390f7f0666","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2017-dccn-aqm/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.674944Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2017-dccn-aqm/","section":"publication","summary":"The article is devoted to the application of Markov modulated arrival processes (Markov modulated Poisson process — MMPP, Markov modulated Bernoulli process — MMBP and Markov modulated fluid flow — MMFF) models to the analysis of Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms (Random Early Detection (RED) family, for example).

The general direction of research aimed at the construction of the stochastic model that predicts the change in wind speed depending on time. The aim of this work is to find the optimal distribution for the approximation of available statistical data on wind speed. We examine four distributions with heavy tails, namely, the log-normal, gamma,Weibull and beta distribution. Each distribution is parameterized by three parameters (the beta distribution has four). For data processing, we used Python with NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. From the SciPy library we used statistics module that contains the function to search the parameters of the distribution provided by method of maximum likelihood. After finding the parameters of the distributions were drawn the graphs of the density distributions, which were verified with the histogram of the frequency distribution. The obtained results allow to assert that all distributions with good accuracy can be used for the purposes of approximation. However, the study quantile-quantile graphs revealed that the Weibull distribution better approximate extreme values. The obtained results are consistent with the data presented in the literature, whereWeibull distribution is often used to approximate the distribution of the wind speed.

While the gauge condition is introduced ad hoc from some external reasons in the Lagrangian formalism. However, the use of the Hamiltonian formalism in the field theory is difficult due to the non-regularity of the field Lagrangian. We must use such variant of the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism, which would allow us to work with the field models, in particular, to solve the problem of electrodynamics. We suggest to use the modern differential geometry and the algebraic topology, in particular the theory of fiber bundles, as a mathematical apparatus. This apparatus leads to greater clarity in the understanding of mathematical structures, associated with physical and technical models. The usage the fiber bundles theory allows us to deepen and expand both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalism. We can detect a wide range of these formalisms. Also we can select the most appropriate formalism. Actually just using the fiber bundles formalism we can adequately solve the problems of the field theory, in particular the problems of electrodynamics.","tags":["rfbr14-01-00628","rfbr15-07-08795","rfbr16-07-00556","rinc","rudn5-100","scopus","wos","rinc"],"title":"A Geometric Approach to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism of Electrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edik Artashevich Ayrjan","A.

Our modelling method for the radiation modes consists in reducing the initial potential scattering problem (in the case of the continuous spectrum) to the equivalent ones for the Jost functions: the Jost solution from the left for the substrate radiation modes and the Jost solution from the right for the cover radiation modes.","tags":["rfbr14-01-00628","rfbr15-07-08795","rfbr16-07-00556","rudn5-100","sjr-q3","wos","rinc","scopus"],"title":"Numerical and Analytical Modeling of Guided Modes of a Planar Gradient Waveguide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michal Hnatič","Ekaterina Gennadyevna Eferina","Anna Vladislavovna Korolkova","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov","Leonid Antonovich Sevastyanov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"8c63837c202156bc079bf6907faccf75","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2016-epj-doi/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.693586Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2016-epj-doi/","section":"publication","summary":"Background.

But there is virtually no methods of coordinated (depended on structure of the system) stochastic introduction into deterministic models. Authors have improved the method of stochastic models construction for the class of one-step processes and illustrated by models of population dynamics. Population dynamics was chosen for study because its deterministic models were sufficiently well explored that allows to compare the results with already known ones. To optimize the models creation as much as possible some routine operations should be automated. In this case, the process of drawing up the model equations can be algorithmized and implemented in the computer algebra system. Furthermore, on the basis of these results a set of programs for numerical experiment can be obtained. The computer algebra system Axiom is used for analytical calculations implementation. To perform the numerical experiment FORTRAN and Julia languages are used. The Runge–Kutta method for stochastic differential equations is used as numerical method. The program complex for creating stochastic one-step processes models is constructed. Its application is illustrated by the predator-prey population dynamic system. Computer algebra systems are very convenient for the purposes of rapid prototyping in mathematical models design and analysis.","tags":["rinc","vak","rinc"],"title":"One-Step Stochastic Processes Simulation Software Package","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Migran Nelsonovich Gevorkyan","Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov","Leonid Antonovich Sevastyanov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"e65f297d3cb9c669b0bca21f1a9eb8a2","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2014-conference-grid-2014-julia/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.468848Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2014-conference-grid-2014-julia/","section":"publication","summary":"Julia is new high-level programming language that supports multiple programming styles and primarily focuses on scientific computing [1]. Language has been developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2009 under the MIT license and is available through the public repository on GitHub [2]. Language is under active development and it's latest version is 0.3. Language has built-in tools for parallel and distributed computing, and supports multithreading (coroutines). Developers have mentioned that Julia does not impose any particular style of parallelism on the user but provides a set of blocks that allows implementing parallelism as programmer likes. Julia is scientific oriented language and it influence on all aspects of language. There are built-in mathematical oriented data types in Julia, such as rational and complex numbers. Dynamic type conversion avoids a loss of accuracy, which is important in the scientific calculations. Also a large variety of built-in mathematical functions and a large number of libraries are present. One of the main goals of the language was to achiev high performance close to the C/Fortran, and clarity interpreted languages. Besides compiling source files into an executable program julia has the ability to execute language constructs interactively (like interpreted languages), as well as an interface to support iPython. Another key feature of the language is simple API for functions and subroutines of C/Fortran/Python. The standard library has lots of built-in wrappers for popular libraries (eg, BLAS and LAPACK). Also, there is a possibility to connect external libraries C / Fortran / Python. Julia supports multiple programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, functional programming. Language is under active development and is replenished with libraries for various fields of mathematics, physics and engineering sciences. 1. The Julia Language — http://julialang.org/ 2.

The basic idea is to transform the coefficients of material equations, namely the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the effective geometry of space-time (besides the vacuum Maxwell equations). This allows us to solve the direct and inverse problems, that is, to find the permittivity and magnetic permeability for a given effective geometry (paths of rays), as well as finding an effective geometry on the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The most popular naive geometrization was proposed by J. Plebanski. Under certain limitations it is quite good for solving relevant problems. It should be noted that in his paper only the resulting formulas and exclusively for Cartesian coordinate systems are given. In our work we conducted a detailed derivation of formulas for the naive geometrization of Maxwell's equations, and these formulas are written for an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system. This work is a step toward building a complete covariant geometrization of the macroscopic Maxwell's equations.","tags":null,"title":"A Naive Geometrization of Maxwell's Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dmitry Sergeevich Kulyabov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"69b086252f6f7eeb33c86b99bb337ec0","permalink":"https://yamadharma.github.io/en/publication/kulyabov-2013-conf-maxwell/","publishdate":"2020-03-30T13:58:06.61002Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/kulyabov-2013-conf-maxwell/","section":"publication","summary":"In the problems of transformation optics have to solve extremely complex macroscopic Maxwell equations.
