abstract: For research in the field of transformation optics and for the calculation
  of optically inhomogeneous lenses the method of geometrization of the Maxwell equations
  seems to be perspective. The basic idea is to transform the coefficients of material
  equations, namely the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the effective
  geometry of space-time (besides the vacuum Maxwell equations). This allows us to
  solve the direct and inverse problems, that is, to find the permittivity and magnetic
  permeability for a given effective geometry (paths of rays), as well as finding
  an effective geometry on the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.
  The most popular naive geometrization was proposed by J. Plebanski. Under certain
  limitations it is quite good for solving relevant problems. It should be noted that
  in his paper only the resulting formulas and exclusively for Cartesian coordinate
  systems are given. In our work we conducted a detailed derivation of formulas for
  the naive geometrization of Maxwell's equations, and these formulas are written
  for an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system. This work is a step toward building
  a complete covariant geometrization of the macroscopic Maxwell's equations.
