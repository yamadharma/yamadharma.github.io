CEUR-WS conference repository.

## <span class="section-num">1</span> Generic information {#generic-information}

-   Site: <http://ceur-ws.org/>
-   Blog: <https://ceurws.wordpress.com/>


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

-   CEUR-WS focuses on:
    -   workshops (rather not conferences);
    -   computer science (i.e. authors should mostly come from a computer science background).


### <span class="section-num">2.1</span> Workshop {#workshop}

-   Conference proceedings can only be accepted as an exception, e.g.
    -   if they have a long history with CEUR-WS;
    -   they made a prior agreement with CEUR-WS.
-   There are some event that label themselves conferences but have more the size of a workshop, i.e. 20 or less papers.
    -   CEUR-WS does not see a problem to accept such submission, even though the organizers should be advised to call the event a workshop in the future.


### <span class="section-num">2.2</span> Computer science {#computer-science}

-   CEUR-WS.org publishes computer science proceedings.
-   A computer science workshop proceedings is characterized as follows:
    -   The organizers and program committee members come overwhelmingly from computer-science departments and have a degree in computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The vast majority of papers included in the proceedings have at least one author coming from a computer science department and/or having a computer-science degree (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The papers in the proceedings mainly apply research methods from computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   It is not sufficient to use computer programs for conducting the research while applying research methods from another discipline such as material science.
-   Example of typical computer science areas are:
    -   computational complexity (theoretical), concurrency in computation;
    -   knowledge representation and reasoning;
    -   artificial intelligence, machine learning (e.g. novel algorithms);
    -   database systems, transactions;
    -   information management, information systems, business informatics;
    -   user interface design;
    -   software engineering, requirements engineering, conceptual modeling (UML,...), software testing;
    -   business process modeling;
    -   programming languages, domain-specific languages, their semantics.
-   CEUR-WS is for computer science (CS), not the broader area of IT.
-   Still, CS does sometimes include mathematical models or proofs.
-   But the criterion is that the majority of the methods used should be from computer science.
-   To publish in CEUR-WS, the focus should be on computer science aspects, not on the mathematical problem.
-   In the past, we sometimes published proceedings leaning to mathematical modeling.
-   But the editorial board of CEUR-WS decided to look more strictly at the computer science content in a submission. It should be mostly computer science.


### <span class="section-num">2.3</span> English {#english}

-   The majority (50% or more) of the papers in a volume must be in English.
    -   English is the de facto standard when you want to target an international audience.
    -   The submitted papers have to be written in the Latin alphabet. Spell author names in Latin characters (accents are allowed).
    -   Avoid non-Latin characters in the paper titles (in some cases special characters, e.g. for mathematical concepts, are allowed).
-   If you submit papers written in a language different to English, we must be able to verify the scientific character of the papers.
    -   Therefore, for papers written in a language different than English, we require that you provide an English translation of the paper titles in the index file and additional English abstracts in the papers.
    -   This is not just to be able to verify the scientific character of a paper, but also to make the content of these papers accessible to the international scientific community.
    -   An English abstract and title allows any scientist to decide whether the contribution of a paper is relevant to his or her research.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Conference Compliance Checklist {#conference-compliance-checklist}

-   [ ] Is this WS located to the well-known conference?
-   [ ] What about the PC? Are there different names and people with a good dblp footprint?
-   [ ] Editors and author footprint also high?
-   [ ] No university/institution contributes more than 25% of  the papers in a submitted volume, regardless whether the author is the first author or a  co-author.
-   [ ] No organizer have more than 1 paper in a submitted volume.
-   [ ] No  university/institution contributes more than 25% of the members of the program committee.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Why a workshop might be rejected {#why-a-workshop-might-be-rejected}

-   Virtually all papers are by PhD students of a single university.
-   All PC members are from a single university.
-   The PhD symposium has many submissions, all were accepted.
-   The symposium was not affiliated to an international conference.


## <span class="section-num">5</span> Mathematical modeling {#mathematical-modeling}

-   CEUR-WS is for computer science (CS), not the broader area of IT. Still, CS does sometimes include mathematical models or proofs. But the criterion is that the majority of the methods used should be from computer science. I checked some of the submitted papers. They mostly cite articles from mathematical journals, not from computer science journals. This indicates that the author is from mathematics and the subject is (mostly) a mathematical subject.

Hard problems are solved by mathematicians. A team of computer scientists and mathematicians can tackle hard problems and produce a convincing solution.

To publish in CEUR-WS, the focus should be on computer science aspects (see above areas), not on the mathematical problem. You can also check yourself the background of the authors by looking up their DBLP footprint, i.e. how many of their papers are indexed in DBLP.org.

In the past, we sometimes published proceedings leaning to mathematical modeling. But the editorial board of CEUR-WS decided to look more strictly at the computer science content in a submission. It should be mostly computer science.
