abstract: It is assumed that the introduction of stochastic in mathematical model
  makes it more adequate. But there is virtually no methods of coordinated (depended
  on structure of the system) stochastic introduction into deterministic models. Authors
  have improved the method of stochastic models construction for the class of one-step
  processes and illustrated by models of population dynamics. Population dynamics
  was chosen for study because its deterministic models were sufficiently well explored
  that allows to compare the results with already known ones. To optimize the models
  creation as much as possible some routine operations should be automated. In this
  case, the process of drawing up the model equations can be algorithmized and implemented
  in the computer algebra system. Furthermore, on the basis of these results a set
  of programs for numerical experiment can be obtained. The computer algebra system
  Axiom is used for analytical calculations implementation. To perform the numerical
  experiment FORTRAN and Julia languages are used. The Runge–Kutta method for stochastic
  differential equations is used as numerical method. The program complex for creating
  stochastic one-step processes models is constructed. Its application is illustrated
  by the predator-prey population dynamic system. Computer algebra systems are very
  convenient for the purposes of rapid prototyping in mathematical models design and
  analysis.
