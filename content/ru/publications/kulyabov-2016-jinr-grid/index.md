abstract: When we organize parallel computations on a cluster system, the computer
  system structure is not hidden from the user, and should be taken into account while
  writing parallel programs. GRID ideology introduces an additional level of abstraction
  and makes it possible to link together heterogeneous computing systems. In fact,
  the inability to control the operating environment makes developers to create superfluous
  infrastructure at the application level. We offer to go down to the below level
  and to implement the necessary functionality within the operating environment kernel.
  Plan9 operating system has the immanent structure necessary for the implementation
  of GRID ideology. The main architectural elements of the operating system allow
  you to use all the resources of the remote computer as the local resources.
