 abstract = {Self-oscillating modes in computer networks control systems quite negatively affect the characteristics of these networks. The problem of finding the areas of self-oscillations is actual and important as the study of parameters of self-oscillations. Due to the significant nonlinearity of control characteristics, the study of the oscillatory modes presents certain difficulties. This paper describes the technique of research of self-oscillating modes on the basis of the control theory. This material is rather methodical than exploratory one.},
