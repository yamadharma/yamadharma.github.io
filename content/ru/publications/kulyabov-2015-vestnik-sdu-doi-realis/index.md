abstract: During development of methods for stochastization of one-step processes
  the attention was focused on obtaining the stochastic equations in the form of the
  Langevin, since this form of stochastic equations is most usual in the construction
  and study of one-step processes models. When applying the method there is the problem
  of justifying the transition from master equation to the Fokker--Planck equation
  for the different versions of the model. However, the forms of partial differential
  equations (master equation and the Fokker--Planck equation) wider description of
  the model to researchers. It is proposed to treat these equations with the help
  of perturbation theory in the framework of quantum field theory. For this purpose
  the methodology was described and the analytical software complex was constructed
  to write down put the main kinetic equation in the operator form in the Fock representation.
  To solve the resulting equation the software complex generates Feynman diagrams
  for the corresponding order of perturbation theory. The FORM system was applied
  as a system of symbolic computation. Selecting FORM as the CAS is reasonable because
  that the given computer algebra system allows for symbolic computation, using the
  resources of high-performance computing. In particular, it is possible to use parallel
  computing technologies such as OpenMP and MPI.
