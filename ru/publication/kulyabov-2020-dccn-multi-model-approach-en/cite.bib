 abstract = {Different kinds of models are used to study various natural and technical phenomena. Usually, the researcher is limited to using a certain kind of model approach, not using others (or even not realizing the existence of other model approaches). The authors believe that a complete study of a certain phenomenon should cover several model approaches. The paper describes several model approaches that we used in the study of the random early detection active queue management algorithm. Both the model approaches themselves and their implementation and the results obtained are described.},
