 abstract = {For the study and verification of our mathematical model of telecommunication systems a discrete simulation model and a continuous analytical model were developed. However, for various reasons, these implementations are not entirely satisfactory. It is necessary to develop a more adequate simulation model, possibly using a different modeling paradigm. In order to modeling of the TCP source it is proposed to use a hybrid (continuous-discrete) approach. For computer implementation of the model the physical modeling language Modelica is used. The hybrid approach allows us to take into account the transitions between different states in the continuous model of the TCP protocol. The considered approach allowed to obtain a simple simulation model of TCP source. This model has great potential for expansion. It is possible to implement different types of TCP.},
