abstract: We have obtained exact kink-like static plane-symmetric solutions to the
  self-consistent system of electromagnetic, scalar, and gravitational field equations.
  It was shown that under certain choice of the interaction Lagrangian the solutions
  are regular and have localized energy. The linearized instability of corresponding
  solutions was established both for the case of flat space-time and that of interaction
  with the proper gravitational field.
