 abstract = {According to the modest opinion of the authors, data science, machine learning, neural networks are extremely relevant areas of science. Around them there was an expectation that attracted lovers of quick results. This does not detract from the importance and benefit of these areas of science. In the paper, the authors took an attempt to briefly describe their experience in organizing work with data analysis using neural networks and machine learning methods.},
