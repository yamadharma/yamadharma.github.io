abstract: "The experience of integration of the computing cluster into the information
  system of facility is described. The cluster is comprised of one control node (2×CPU
  Intel Xeon E5-2670, 64 Гб RAM) and two compute nodes (1×CPU Xeon E5-2670, 64 Гб
  RAM, 1×GPU Nvidia Tesla M2090). The following problems had to be solved during cluster
  configuration. Integration of the cluster authentication system with faculty's local
  network authentication system. Setting the consistent software updates on the cluster's
  control node and the compute nodes. The centralized initial cluster setup with help
  of xcat utility. Installing additional software with CUDA technology support. Creating
  the local software repository for specific software support (for example, PBS /
  Torque with CUDA support). The following software were to be installed on the cluster:
  GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) [2], with gfortran version 4.4.7 с OpenMP [3], Julia
  language compiler [4], Python interpreter version 2.7. Oslo following libraries
  have been installed: OpenMPI [5], MPICH [6], BLAS [7], LAPACK [8], GSL (GNU Scientific
  Library) [9], GAMESS (US) (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System)
  [10], Python NumPy and SciPy [11]. All the software listed above is widely known
  and a good account of itself in the field of scientific computing. However, it may
  be useful to give a little bit more details about Julia programming language — the
  new open source programming language that is in the stage of active development.
  Julia language has created to achieve following goals: multiparadigmality, focus
  on scientific computing, the possibility of interactive language constructions execution
  (like iPython), achieving the performance close to C/C++ and Fortran, built-in support
  of parallel computing, easy integration of an external Fortran and C/C++ libraries.
