abstract: Along with the use of geometric constructions in the physics is possible to use of arithmetic ideas (aka arithmetic physics). Extremely promising is the use of rather rational numbers p-adic and adele numbers. As one of the stages of the program to create the package for symbolic manipulation of p-adic numbers. Currently incorporates basic arithmetic operations, as well as features such as sin, cos, sqrt, log.
