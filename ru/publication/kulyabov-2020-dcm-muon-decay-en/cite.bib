 abstract = {The history of using machine learning algorithms to analyze statistical models is quite long. The development of computer technology has given these algorithms a new breath. Nowadays deep learning is mainstream and most popular area in machine learning. However, the authors believe that many researchers are trying to use deep learning methods beyond their applicability. This happens because of the widespread availability of software systems that implement deep learning algorithms, and the apparent simplicity of research. All this motivate the authors to compare deep learning algorithms and classical machine learning algorithms. The Large Hadron Collider experiment is chosen for this task, because the authors are familiar with this scientific field, and also because the experiment data is open source. The article compares various machine learning algorithms in relation to the problem of recognizing the decay reaction ?-→ ?-+?-+?+at the Large Hadron Collider. The authors use open source implementations of machine learning algorithms. We compare algorithms with each other based on calculated metrics. As a result of the research, we can conclude that all the considered machine learning methods are quite comparable with each other (taking into account the selected metrics), while different methods have different areas of applicability.},
