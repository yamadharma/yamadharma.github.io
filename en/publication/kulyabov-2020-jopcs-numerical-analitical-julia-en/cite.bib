 abstract = {It is known that modeling consists of a few stages. Analytic calculations are made first and afterwards, they are converted into numerical ones. It is a fairly complicated task, but it can easily be solved with the help of programming languages with the support of a numericalâ€“analytical approach. In this case, the program can generate a numerical scheme for the solution based on the given analytical equation. The possibility of high-level work and differential equations' modeling is obtained through the access to the additional packages. This article overviews one of the approaches, specifically the usage of the different integrated DSL packages in Julia language.},
