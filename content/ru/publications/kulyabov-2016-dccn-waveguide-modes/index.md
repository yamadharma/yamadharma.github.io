abstract: "The mathematical model of light propagation in a planar gradient optical
  waveguide consists of the Maxwell's equations supplemented by the matter equations
  and boundary conditions. In the coordinates adapted to the waveguide geometry, the
  Maxwell's equations are separated into two independent sets for the TE and TM polarizations.
  For each polarization there are three types of waveguide modes in a regular planar
  optical waveguide: guided modes, substrate radiation modes, and cover radiation
  modes. In this work we implement the numerical-analytical calculation of all types
  of waveguide modes. For the eigenvalue problem with a piecewise linear-constant
  potential we used the Airy functions to calculate the cover radiation modes and
  substrate radiation modes. We took advantage of reducing the initial potential scattering
  problem (in the case of the continuous spectrum) to the equivalent ones for the
  Jost functions: the Jost solution from the left for the substrate radiation modes
  and the Jost solution from the right for the cover radiation modes."
