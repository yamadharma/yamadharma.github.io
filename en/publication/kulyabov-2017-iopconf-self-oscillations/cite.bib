 abstract = {Self-oscillating modes in control systems of computer networks quite negatively affect the characteristics of these networks. The problem of finding the areas of self-oscillations is actual and important as the study of parameters of self-oscillations. Due to the significant nonlinearity of control characteristics, the study of the self-oscillating modes presents certain difficulties. This paper describes the technique of research of self-oscillating modes.},
