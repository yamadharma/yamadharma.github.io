 abstract = {In this paper we consider pseudo-random uniformly distributed number generators, such as xorshift and KISS. We also provide C++ implementation source code snippets of these algorithms and the results of tests made with dieharder utility. We also mention the possibility of parallelization and briefly discuss the idea of neural networks usage for pseudo-random numbers generation.},
