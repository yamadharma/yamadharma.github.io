abstract: A new method for the evaluation of the characteristics of the solution of a system of stochastic differential equations is presented. This method is based on the representation of a probability density function p through a functional integral. The functional integral representation is obtained by means of the Onsager-Machlup functional technique for a special case when the diffusion matrix for the SDE system defines a Riemannian space with zero curvature.
