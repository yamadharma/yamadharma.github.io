 abstract = {This work is devoted to the study of the capabilities of the Modelica and Julia programming languages for the implementation of a continuously discrete paradigm in modeling hybrid systems that contain both continuous and discrete aspects of behavior. A system consisting of an incoming stream that is processed according to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and a router that processes traffic using the Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm acts as a simulated threshold system.},
