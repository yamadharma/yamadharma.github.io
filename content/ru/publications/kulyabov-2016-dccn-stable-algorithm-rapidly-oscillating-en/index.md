abstract: The work describes the new regularized algorithm for computing integrals
  of rapidly oscillating functions allowing effectively and accurately determine the
  required value in the presence of stationary points. In the case where the phase
  function has stationary points (its derivative vanishes on the interval of integration),
  the calculation of the corresponding integral is still a sufficiently difficult
  task even for the Levin method due to the degeneracy of the resulting system of
  linear equations. The basic idea of regularization, described in the article, is
  the simultaneous modification of the amplitude and phase functions, which does not
  change the integrand, but eliminates the degeneracy of the phase function on the
  interval of integration. The regularized algorithm presented in the work is based
  on the Levin collocation method and describes the stable method of integration of
  rapidly oscillating functions at the presence of station- ary points. Performance
  and high accuracy of the algorithms are illustrated by various examples.
