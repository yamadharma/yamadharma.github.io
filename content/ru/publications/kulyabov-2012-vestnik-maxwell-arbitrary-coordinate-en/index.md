abstract: The article is devoted to application of tensorial formalism for derivation
  of different types of Maxwell's equations. The Maxwell's equations are written in
  the covariant coordinate-free and the covariant coordinate forms. Also the relation
  between vectorial and tensorial formalisms and differential operators for arbitrary
  holonomic coordinate system in coordinate form is given. The results obtained by
  tensorial and vectorial formalisms are verified in cylindrical and spherical coordinate
  systems.
