 abstract = {Self-oscillation modes in control systems of data transmission networks negatively affect the characteristics of these networks. To investigate the self-oscillation mode for systems with a control module, the analytical model of the active queue management module was developed. The problem of verifi- cation of the obtained theoretical results arises in the study. Previously, a software system was developed for software emulation of the router. However, its use has caused some difficulties. Alternatively, the simulation model of network with active queue management module was developed. The paper describes a software package for verifying theoretical calculations based on the NS-2 simulation system. For illus- tration, a numerical example is given.},
