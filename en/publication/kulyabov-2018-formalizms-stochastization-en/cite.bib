 abstract = {To construct realistic mathematical models from the first principles, the authors suggest using the stochastization method. In a number of works different approaches to stochastization of mathematical models were considered. In the end, the whole variety of approaches was reduced to two formalisms: combinatorial (state vectors) and operator (occupation numbers). In the article the authors briefly describe these formalisms with an emphasis on their practical application.},
