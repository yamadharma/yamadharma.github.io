abstract: Spinors are more special objects than tensor. Therefore possess more properties than the more generic objects such as tensors. Thus, the group of Lorentz two-spinors is the covering group of the Lorentz group. Since the Lorentz group is a symmetry group of Maxwell's equations, it is assumed to reasonable to use when writing the Maxwell equations Lorentz two-spinors and not tensors. We describe in detail the representation of the Maxwell's equations in the form of Lorentz two-spinors. This representation of Maxwell's equations can be of considerable theoretical interest.
