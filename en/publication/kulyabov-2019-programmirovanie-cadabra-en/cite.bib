 abstract = {In certain scientific domains, there is a need for tensor operations. To facilitate tensor computations, computer algebra systems are employed. In our research, we have been using Cadabra as the main computer algebra system for several years. Recently, an operable second version of this software was released. In this version, a number of improvements were made that can be regarded as revolutionary ones. The most significant improvements are the implementation of component computations and the change in the ideology of the Cadabra's software mechanism as compared to the first version. This paper provides a brief overview of the key improvements in the Cadabra system.},
