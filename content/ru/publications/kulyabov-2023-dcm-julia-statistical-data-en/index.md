abstract: The Julia programming language is a specialized language for scientific computing. It is relatively new, so most of the libraries for it are in the active development stage. In this article, the authors consider the possibilities of the language in the field of mathematical statistics. Special emphasis is placed on the technical component, in particular, the process of installing and configuring the software environment is described in detail. Since users of the Julia language are often not professional programmers, technical issues in setting up the software environment can cause difficulties that prevent them from quickly mastering the basic features of the language. The article also describes some features of Julia that distinguish it from other popular languages used for scientific computing. The third part of the article provides an overview of the two main libraries for mathematical statistics. The emphasis is again on the technical side in order to give the reader an idea of the general possibilities of the language in the field of mathematical statistics.
