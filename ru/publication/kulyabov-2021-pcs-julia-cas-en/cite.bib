 abstract = {Recently, the place of the main programming language for scientific and engineering computations has been little by little taken by Julia. Some users want to work completely within the Julia ecosystem like they work within the Python ecosystem. There are libraries for Julia that cover the majority of scientific and engineering computations demands. The aim of this paper is to combine the usage of Julia framework for numerical computations and for symbolic computations in mathematical modeling problems. The main functional domains determining various variants of the application of computer algebra systems are described. In each of these domains, generic representatives of computer algebra systems in Julia are distinguished. The conclusion is that it is possible (and even convenient) to use computer algebra systems within the Julia ecosystem.},
