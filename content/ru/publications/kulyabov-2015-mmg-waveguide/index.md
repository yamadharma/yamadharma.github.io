abstract: "In a planar regular optical waveguide, propagation of polarized monochromatic
  electromagnetic radiation obeys a law following from the Maxwell equations. The
  Maxwell equations in Cartesian coordinates associated with the waveguide geometry
  can be written as the two independent systems of equations: E x = dH y $β$ dE z
  ik 0 H y , = $ε$$μ$ − $β$ 2 H y , = ik 0 $ε$E z , $ε$ dx $ε$ dx dE y $β$ dH z ik
  0 H x = − E y , = − $ε$$μ$ − $β$ 2 E y , = −ik 0 $μ$H z . $μ$ dx $μ$ dx Each of
  the systems can be transformed to a second order ODE for the lead- ing component
  and two other equations for straightforward computation of the complementary electromagnetic
  field components. In doing so, the boundary con- ditions for Maxwell's equations
  are reduced to two pairs of boundary conditions for obtained equations. In addition,
  the asymptotic conditions hold for each class of waveguide modes. Thus, the problem
  of description of a complete set of modes in a regular planar waveguide is formulated
  in terms of the eigenvalues problem for the essentially self-adjoint second order
  differential operator: − d 2 $ψ$ + V (x) $ψ$ = k 2 $ψ$. dx 2 For the operator, we
  find some results about its spectrum, complete sets of so- lutions, and diagonalization
  by an isometric isomorphism (generalized Fourier transformation); new basis functions
  are related to initial ones by simple trans- formation formulas. The eigenvalues
  problem is equivalently reduced to the two problems (left and right) of the one-dimensional
  potential scattering theory by projection on the two branches of the continuous
  spectrum."
