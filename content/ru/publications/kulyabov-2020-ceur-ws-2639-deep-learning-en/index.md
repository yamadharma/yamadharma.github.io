abstract: Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a benign skin lesion. Its early detection is extremely important, since the life of patients with melanoma depends on accurate and early diagnosis of the disease. However, doctors often rely on personal experience and assess each patient's injuries based on a personal examination. Clinical studies allow us to get the accuracy of the diagnosis of melatoma from 65 to 80 percents, which was a good result for some time. However, modern research claims that the use of dermoscopic images in diagnosis significantly increases the accuracy ofdiagnosis ofskin lesions. The visual differences between melanoma and benign skin lesions can be very small, making diagnosis difficult even for an expert doctor. Recent advances in the use of artificial intelligence methods in the analysis of medical images have made it possible to consider the development of intelligent medical diagnostic systems based on visualization as a very promising direction that will help the doctor in making more effective decisions about the health of patients and making a diagnosis at an early stage and in adverse conditions. In this paper, we propose an approach to solving the problem of classification of skin diseases, namely, melanoma at an early stage, based on deep learning. In particular, a solution to the problem of classification of a dermoscopic image containing either malignant or benign skin lesions is proposed. For this purpose, the deep neural network architecture was developed and applied to image processing. Computer experiments on the ISIC data set have shown that the proposed approach provides 92% accuracy on the test sample, which is significantly higher than other algorithms in this data set have shown.
