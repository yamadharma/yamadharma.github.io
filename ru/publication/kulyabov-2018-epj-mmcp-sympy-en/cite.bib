 abstract = {SymPy computer algebra library is used for automatic generation of ordinary and stochastic systems of differential equations from the schemes of kinetic interaction. Schemes of this type are used not only in chemical kinetics but also in biological, ecological and technical models. This paper describes the automatic generation algorithm with an emphasis on application details.},
