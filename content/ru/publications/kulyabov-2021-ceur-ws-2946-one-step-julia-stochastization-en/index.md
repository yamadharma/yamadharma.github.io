abstract: 'In this paper, we use the method of stochastization of one-step processes to demonstrate the advantages of a stochastic representation of the system. To achieve this goal, the high-level scientific computing language Julia was chosen. Because the chosen approach is based on the paradigm of analytical-numerical calculations, then its implementation will be performed using auxiliary packages that are domain-specific extensions (DSL): Catalyst.jl and DifferentialEquations.jl. As a result of this work, the method of stochastization of one-step processes was applied to the SIR epidemic model.'
