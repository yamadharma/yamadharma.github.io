 abstract = {This work is devoted to some aspects of using the general renovation (the definition and brief overview are given) as the active queue management mechanism (like RED (Random Early Detection) algorithms). The attention is paid to the queuing system in which a threshold mechanism and the general renovation mechanism are implemented. This allows to adjust the number of packets in the system by dropping (resetting) the packets from the queue depending on the ratio of a certain control parameter with specified thresholds. But in contrast to standard RED-like systems, a possible reset occurs not at the time of arriving of the next packets in the system, but at the time of the end of service on the device (server). Numerical results for the main probability characteristic (stationary loss probability) are presented.},
