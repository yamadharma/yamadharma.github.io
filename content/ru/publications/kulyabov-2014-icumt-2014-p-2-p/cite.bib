 abstract = {The models of peer to peer protocols are presented with the help of one-step processes. On the basis of this presentation and the method of randomization of one-step processes, it is described method for constructing models of peer to peer protocols. The models of FastTrack and Bittorrent protocols are studied by means of proposed method.},
