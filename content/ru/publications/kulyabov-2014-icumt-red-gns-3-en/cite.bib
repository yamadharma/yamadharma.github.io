 abstract = {The problem of RED-module mathematical model results verification, based on GNS3 experimental stand, is discussed in this article. The experimental stand consists of virtual Cisco router, traffic generator D-ITG and traffic receiver. The process of construction of such stand is presented. Also, the interaction between experimental stand and a computer of investigation in order to obtain and analyze data from stand is revised.},
