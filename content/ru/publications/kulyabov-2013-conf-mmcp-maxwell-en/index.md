abstract: In the problems of transformation optics have to solve extremely complex
  macroscopic Maxwell equations. To simplify the calculations, instead of macroscopic
  Maxwell equations in the plane space-time is proposed to write vacuum Maxwell equations
  in curved space-time. For this tensor polarization-magnetization geometrized in
  the sense of the field theory of gravity. As an implementation of this method calculates
  the lenses.
