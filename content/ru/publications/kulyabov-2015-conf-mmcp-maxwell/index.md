abstract: Background Spinors are more special objects than tensor. Therefore possess
  more properties than the more generic objects such as tensors. Group of Lorentz
  two-spinors is the covering group of the Lorentz group. Purpose Since the Lorentz
  group is a symmetry group of Maxwell's equations, it is assumed to reasonable to
  use when writing the Maxwell equations Lorentz two-spinors and not tensors. Method
  We write the Maxwell equations using Lorentz two-spinors. Also used a convenient
  representation of Lorentz two-spinors in terms of the Riemann- Silberstein's complex
  vectors. Results In the spinor formalism (in the representation of the Lorentz spinors
  and Riemann-Silberstein's vectors) we have constructed the Hamiltonian of Maxwellian
  optics. With the use of spinors Maxwell's equations take the form similar to the
  Dirac equation. Conclusions For Maxwell's equations in the Dirac-like form we can
  expand re- search methods at the expense of the methods of quantum field theory.
  In this form, clearly visible the connection between the Hamiltonians of geometric,
  beam and Maxwellian optics.
