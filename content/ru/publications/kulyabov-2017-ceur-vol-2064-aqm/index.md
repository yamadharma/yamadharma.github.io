abstract: In data networks, a negative phenomenon such as global synchronization can
  occur. It manifests itself in the form of auto-oscillations, which may capture the
  whole segment of the network. As a result, the network parameters such as the bandwidth,
  latency, etc. are degraded. The reason for this phenomenon is the interaction of
  control elements in the network (for example, active traffic management modules)
  and protocols such as TCP. To prevent this phenomenon, it is proposed to control
  the parameters of the network control elements (since the prospects of a radical
  modification of the TCP protocol seem somewhat illus ory to us). Specifically, we
  are studying the active traffic control modules of the RED type. To isolate the
  main parameters on which the occurrence of self-oscillations may depend, we assumed
  to linearize the m odel with its subsequent investigation. However, the standard
  linearization leads to the disappearance of the self-oscillatory regime. We suggest
  to use the method of harmonic linearization, which preserves the self-oscillatory
  regime. So the method of harmonic linearization is briefly considered in our paper.
  We also highlight the main criteria that can be used to determine the presence of
  self-oscillations and to det ermine their parameters. The application of the harmonic
  linearization method is demonstrated with the help of the RED active traffic control
  module.
