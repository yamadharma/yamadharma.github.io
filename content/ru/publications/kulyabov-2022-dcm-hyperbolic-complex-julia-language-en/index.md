abstract: Hyperbolic complex numbers are used in the description of hyperbolic spaces. One of the well-known examples of such spaces is the Minkowski space, which plays a leading role in the problems of the special theory of relativity and electrodynamics. However, such numbers are not very common in different programming languages. Of interest is the implementation of hyperbolic complex in scientific programming languages, in particular, in the Julia language. The Julia language is based on the concept of multiple dispatch. This concept is an extension of the concept of polymorphism for object-oriented programming languages. To implement hyperbolic complex numbers, the multiple dispatching approach of the Julia language was used. The result is a library that implements hyperbolic numbers. Based on the results of the study, we can conclude that the concept of multiple dispatching in scientific programming languages is convenient and natural.
