 abstract = {For research in the field of transformation optics and for the calculation of optically inhomogeneous lenses the method of geometrization of the Maxwell equations seems to be perspective. The basic idea is to transform the coefficients of material equations, namely the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the effective geometry of space-time (besides the vacuum Maxwell equations). This allows us to solve the direct and inverse problems, that is, to find the permittivity and magnetic permeability for a given effective geometry (paths of rays), as well as finding an effective geometry on the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The most popular naive geometrization was proposed by J. Plebanski. Under certain limitations it is quite good for solving relevant problems. It should be noted that in his paper only the resulting formulas and exclusively for Cartesian coordinate systems are given. In our work we conducted a detailed derivation of formulas for the naive geometrization of Maxwell's equations, and these formulas are written for an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system. This work is a step toward building a complete covariant geometrization of the macroscopic Maxwell's equations.},
