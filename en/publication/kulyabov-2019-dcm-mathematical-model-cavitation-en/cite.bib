 abstract = {This paper describes the created mathematical model that allows you to explore the dynamics of cavitation bubbles under the influence of a single negative pressure pulse. The time dependence and coordinates of the parameters of the carrier phase, the temperature and pressure of the vapor phase, the concentration and size of the bubbles are determined numerically. It is concluded that the model created gives a good agreement between the calculated and experimental data.},
