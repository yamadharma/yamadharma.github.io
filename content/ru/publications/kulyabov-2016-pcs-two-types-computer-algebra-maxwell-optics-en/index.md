abstract: 'To synthesize Maxwell optics systems, the mathematical apparatus of tensor and vector analysis is generally employed. This mathematical apparatus implies executing a great number of simple stereotyped operations, which are adequately supported by computer algebra systems. In this paper, we distinguish between two stages of working with a mathematical model: model development and model usage. Each of these stages implies its own computer algebra system. As a model problem, we consider the problem of geom- etrization of Maxwell''s equations. Two computer algebra systems—Cadabra and FORM—are selected for use at different stages of investigation.'
