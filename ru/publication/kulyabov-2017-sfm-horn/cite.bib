 abstract = {We investigate the waveguide propagation of polarized monochromatic light in a smoothly irregular transition between two regular planar dielectric waveguides. The single-mode approximation of the cross-sections method is used. The smooth evolution of the electromagnetic field propagating mode is calculated. The calculation is performed using the regularized stable numerical method.},
